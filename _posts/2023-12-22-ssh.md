# Access to a container in local from host (Don't confuse with localhost(Ubuntu). host is my mac. local or localhost is Ubuntu)

Run from iterm (mac)

`ssh -L 9090:localhost:8000 jun@hotcake`

=> mac's 9090 port is tunneled to localhost (hotcake) 8000 port

Run from hotcake  
`docker run -d --name api-server -p 8000:8000 part5-api-server`

=> localhost (hotcake) port 8000 is connected to container's 8000 port.

Access to

[link](http://localhost:9090/docs)

from mac.

## cat /proc/driver/nvidia/version
Show current driver version (NVRM)
nvidia-smi shows NVML library version

---

## sudo apt purge --autoremove '*nvidia*' '*nvidia*:i386'
Remove nvidia packages

## Installing nvidia driver (the one you see when `nvidia-smi`)
install the specific driver you want  
`sudo apt install nvidia-driver-510`

To check which is the recommended driver for your Nvidia card run:  
`ubuntu-drivers devices`

If you want to install the driver automatically, run :  
`sudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall`

If you want to install a specific driver version #(410, 440...), run:  
`sudo apt install nvidia-<driver number>`

---

# Show current version
cat /proc/driver/nvidia/version
