## close and remove a container
```docker
docker stop "CONTAINTER ID"
docker rm "CONTAINER ID"
```

Use `docker ps -a` to see all containers

## host, container

```docker run -p 127.0.0.1:80:8080/tcp```\
This means to bind port 8080 of the container to TCP port 80 on 127.0.0.1 of the host machine.

## how to find a docker host machine's ip address from inside a container?
`sudo ip addr show docker0` gives ip address of docker host machine (in my case 172.17.0.1)\
Also can identify ip address by `docker network inspect bridge`\
Both commands above are run in hotcake (the machine sshed into)\
To see an ip address of a container, run `ip addr show eth0` inside a container. 
* ex:  `root@e77f6a1b3740:/# ip addr show eth0`

## 03. Model Registry 2) Save Model to Registry
```python
os.environ["MLFLOW_S3_ENDPOINT_URL"] = "http://172.17.0.1:9005" # when running in a container, should use host ip address instead of localhost?
os.environ["MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI"] = "http://172.17.0.1:5001"
```
Orignal version uses `"http://localhost:9005"` and `"http://localhost:5001"`. 9005 and 5001 are ports of Linux (remote machine) and are connected to 9091 and 9092 of mac (local) individually.

## How to debug inside a container with vscode
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w77D5KuJ7eE

I think there are two ways: 
1) access to a container with vscode from local (mac) (*Note: local = localhost = mac. host = Ubuntu).
2) access to a conatiner with vscode from remote (linux); need to ssh from mac first (*Note: remote = host. remote is used in the context of ssh whereas host is Docker context).

Method 1):
follow the video

Method 2):
* Install `Remote Development` extension (I thought, for this method, the extension should be installed in linux machine but accessing container also works when the extension is installed on mac)
* click a bottom left button and select `access to running container`
* choose a container (only currently running containers are visible)
